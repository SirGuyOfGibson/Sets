								----KINGDOM RULES----

KEYWORDS:

	The Realm:
		
		This keyword represents the zone in which all Cards, 
		excluding one's deck and hand, exist simultaniously.

	Abilities:
	
		The bolded block of text located at the top of the text field in a card
		is the abilities of that card.  Abilities are seperated by periods. These
		period-delimited sentences are each, individually, their own "Ability". The	
		term "Abilities" represents each individual Ability all wrapped into one container.
		
		Triggering Abilities:
			Some abilities trigger at specific moments in the game.  These are
			Triggered Abilities.  If an Ability starts with any of the phrases below,
			it is a Triggered Ability, and triggers at the described time.
			
				"At the beginning/end of your turn"
				"Whenever _________________"
				"When __________________"
				
	Create:
	
		Put a new card into play from your hand, or in some cases, Create can
		mean simply making a card out of thin air, kind of like a Token
		from Magic: the Gathering. Any uses of the Create keyword will be
		self explanitory as to whether you make a "token" or play from your hand.
		
		If the keyword instance is worded: "You may create ______" it means 
		playing from your hand. 
		
		If it is worded: "Create ______" it is not optional, and creates a "token".
				
	Pawn:
		
		If a card is any of the Classes listed below, it is considered a Pawn
		
			Aristocrat

	Impede [card] for X turns:
		
		To prevent all of a card's Abilities from triggering for X turns.
		
	Impede any Ability:
		
		To prevent an Ability from triggering for 2 turns. When worded this way,
		you may choose any Ability from any card in The Realm.
			
	Cast Away:
		
		To be removed from the game, from The Realm.

	Killed:
		
		To be removed from the game, from The Realm, due to the effect of a Pawn.
		
RESOURCE CONCEPTS:
		
	Governance:

		Governance is the backbone resource for creating Laws, 
		creating Structures, and waging war. Governance is often
		produced by your Aristocracy and only a few other things. The King 
		and Queen are vital components to your Aristocracy, and when you
		lose one of	them, especially early-game, it can be devastating.
		
	Unrest:
		
		In KINGDOM, you will likely gather a lot of Unrest
		at various points in the game. Wartime can be a time of 
		stress in which you will build up a lot of Unrest.
		The best way to look at it is as if each Unrest card is its 
		own card--because it IS. They can, however, be Cast Away using 
		various Abilities, and they even go away on their own depending
		on how much	Governance and Loyalty you have.
			
		At the end of your turn, you may cast away as many Unrest as you have 
		Governance, divided by 10, rounded down (if you have 107 Governance, you may Cast Away 10 Unrest)	
		If you have the most Governance out of all the players, you must then Cast Away Governance equal 
		to the Unrest you got rid of. So with 107 Governance, if you had the most, you'd be down to 97 
		Governance after the Unrest got Cast Away.		
	
	Loyalty:
	
		Loyalty is a representation of how loyal your people are to you (surprise surprise)
		Loyalty and Governance work together to rid your kingdom of Unrest.  Loyalty is 
		often produced by Structures and events, such as winning a war.
		
		Every 5 turns, at the beginning of your turn (that is, you begin this cycle at the 
		beginning of your fifth turn) you may Cast Away up to 1/5 of your Loyalty Cards.
		Consider each Card Cast Away to be a "point".  Then, spend your points however you choose:
		
			2 Points: Cast Away 1 Unrest. The maximum amount of Unrest you're allowed to remove 
					  this way is equal to half of your total Unrest, rounded down.
			
			4 Points: Create 1 Governance.  This can only be done up to 10 times, and CANNOT be done at 
					  all if you have the most Governance already.
					  
			7 Points: Draw a card from your deck. This can only be done up to 4 times.
			

STARTING THE GAME:

	To start off, every player begins with a King, Queen, Prince, and Princess under their control.
	These Cards are vital to building some up Governance early on, the four of them producing 6 per turn.
	
	Players also start the game with 50 Governance, 15 Loyalty,
	
	Pace is vital in KINGDOM, if you go nuts
	producing Structures and passing Laws in the first few turns, you may run low on
	Governance, which results in your Unrest growing at a quicker rate.
